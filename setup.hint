ldesc: "Git is popular version control system designed to handle very
large projects with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various
open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools,
similar to e.g. GNU Arch or Monotone (or BitKeeper in the commercial
world). Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with
full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or
a central server."
